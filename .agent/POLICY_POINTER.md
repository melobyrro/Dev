# Codex Policy Pointer

These rules apply to Codex in this workspace:

- Nearest-CLAUDE.md wins: start in the working directory and walk up until a CLAUDE.md is found.
- Before any edits, open and summarize the applicable CLAUDE.md.
- If CLAUDE.md includes a policy version or last-updated value, echo it in your response.
